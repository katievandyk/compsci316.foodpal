        I developed the front-end design (including the UI images included in the report) as well  problem approach section of the report. Also helped develop framework/system architecture. 


Alex Boss:
        I wrote the outline & initial draft of many of the bullets and edited later versions. I also did research on the tools and technologies needed for the project. 


Bilva Sanaba: 
        Brainstormed and developed ER design and then implemented it into PostgreSQL along with additional triggers and sample queries. Conducted a previous system survey and wrote my findings into the Milestone. Contacted various Duke groups to look into methods for creating out data.

        I met with Seon to discuss the project and wrote the summary of the conversation. I also worked on the ER design, PostgreSQL implementation and sample queries.
 
Ryan Pond:
        Researched previous systems that utilized our basic application model and made sure our idea was unique in both design and implementation.
